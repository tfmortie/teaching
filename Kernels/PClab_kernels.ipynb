    "When trying to solve a binary classification problem, classifiers usually try to separate the positive from the negative class. Often, linear models are not capable of making this separation. An option to deal with this problem is to find an (extended) basis in which the classes are (almost) linearly separable. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the binary classification problem in the figure below. The data depicted in this figure originates from a(n) (unknown) joint distribution, for which the Bayes-optimal decision boundary (in case of the 0/1 loss) is a circle. It is clear that the classes are not linearly separable in the original feature space (which is $\\mathbb{R}^2$). An option is to extend this space using a set of non-linear functions $\\phi_1 (\n",
    "x_1,x_2), ... , \\phi_m (x_1,x_2)$ (note that the identity map can also be chosen for $\\phi_i$). Using these transformations, the representation of an instance $\\mathbf{x_i} = (x_{i,1},x_{i,2})$ becomes $\\mathbf{x_i} = (x_{i,1},x_{i,2}) \\rightarrow \\phi_1(x_{i,1},x_{i,2}),..., \\phi_M(x_{i,1},x_{i,2})$.
