One way to change this is to change the threshold for classification: by selecting a higher threshold, we will predict more samples as negatives, hence the sensitivity will go down because we will now predict some positives as being negative.

    "If it is not immediately clear what the features mean in this example: the first four features represent which word is the first word in each sentence. The first and sentence has as first word 'this', this is the last word in the vocabulary, so of the first four features, the last is given by $1$. The second sentence has 'is' as the first word, which is the second word in the vocabulary, for this reason, the second column of the first four features is given by $1$ for this sentence. Both sentences have the same last two words 'real life', it can be seen that the last 8 features for both sentences are identical.\n",

    "Armed with these encoding schemes, we can tackle a real problem. **DNA sequences** as inputs are peculiar because they are essentially text: following an alphabet containing only A, T, C or G. We will use data from a published [study](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7007-12-4) about sigma factors in E. coli. Some biological background information for those interested:\n",

    "> The binding region of the transcription unit,  commonly called the promoter region, is known to play a key role  in the transcription rate of downstream genes. In Eubacteria, the sigma factor ($\\sigma$) binds with the RNA  polymerase subunit ($\\alpha\\beta\\beta'\\omega$) to create RNA polymerase. Being part of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, the sigma element acts as the connection between RNA polymerase and DNA. Depending on the sigma factor bound to the transcription unit, different binding regions of the enzyme with the DNA are observed. The data represents specific DNA regions of the *E. coli* genome to which one or more sigma factors bind.\n",
    "\n",
    "In less-biological-jargon words: certain molecules called sigma factors control activity of genes, they do so by binding to the DNA close to the gene. If we can predict for an input DNA sequence if such a molecule will bind, we gain an understanding in the biological function of those genes and molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 4724 DNA sequences. For each sequence, we have information on five target variables, each representing 5 sigma factors. Each time, the outcome is binary, indicating whether the sigma factor binds to the sequence or not. This is a **multi-label** problem, where an input can belong to any (multiple at once) of the classes, as opposed to only one possible class for each sample in multi-class. For simplicity in this exercise, we will focus only on one class: RPOD."

    "Use one of the encoding schemes to preprocess the DNA data. Construct a model and evaluate performance on the test set. Play around with different preprocessing values, and keep testing performances. What types of preprocessing lead to good performance for this dataset? In what cases are we overfitting? Think about fair evaluation: if we keep testing out configurations and evaluating on the test set, is our final test performance estimate fair? We can solve this by keeping an additional data split separate: training, validation and testing. Then we test different hyperparameters (different ways of preprocessing) on the validation set. We don't touch the test set until we have our final model. This is the only fair way of evaluating. For more information, see this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets).</b>\n",
