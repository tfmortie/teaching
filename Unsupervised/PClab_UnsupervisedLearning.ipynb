    "_Unsupervised learning_ is a different branch of machine learning, as in this case a response variable $y$ is missing. Therefore, unsupervised learning techniques are most often used for exploratory purposes or as a preprocessing step in a supervised context. Unsupervised learning is more prone to subjectivity because results are harder (or even impossible) to validate. This is why one should be careful with the interpretation of results after unsupervised learning. (Those interested can have a look at the paper [\"Clustering: Science or Art\"](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v27/luxburg12a/luxburg12a.pdf), which summarizes a couple of critics and tries to give some pointers considering the evaluation of clustering algorithms).
